Foursquare-Venue-Console
========================

A developer console for Foursquare's API that allows you to quickly and easily access venue data.

To use, just add your Foursquare API Client key and secret here:

```
// fsEndString = '&client_id=your_client_id&client_secret=your_client_secret&v=20130815';
```

For right now it only supports a basic venue search. I plan on supporting other Foursquare endpoints in the future.
